# Documentation Updates - March 31, 2025

## Changes Made

1. **Added Nginx Configuration Guide**
   - Created a new comprehensive documentation file: `docs/nginx_configuration.md`
   - This guide covers HTTP and HTTPS setup, performance optimization, security enhancements, and troubleshooting for the Nginx configuration

2. **Updated README.md**
   - Added link to the new Nginx Configuration Guide in the Documentation section

3. **Updated INSTALLATION.md**
   - Added a reference to the Nginx Configuration Guide in the Advanced Installation Options section

## Purpose of Changes

These documentation updates address several gaps in the existing documentation:

1. **Centralized Nginx Information**
   - Previously, Nginx configuration information was scattered across multiple files (README-HTTPS.md, docker-compose files)
   - The new guide consolidates all Nginx-related information in one place

2. **Enhanced Security Documentation**
   - Added detailed information about SSL/TLS configuration
   - Provided recommendations for modern security parameters

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Added guidance for optimizing Nginx performance
   - Included memory optimization specific to Nginx

4. **Troubleshooting**
   - Added a comprehensive troubleshooting section for common Nginx issues
   - Provided concrete commands and solutions

## Benefits

1. **Easier Deployment**
   - Users can now quickly find all necessary information about Nginx configuration
   - The documentation provides both basic and advanced configuration options

2. **Improved Security**
   - Following the recommendations in the guide will result in more secure deployments
   - Clear instructions for HTTPS setup will encourage more secure installations

3. **Better Performance**
   - The performance optimization section provides tangible improvements for production deployments
   - Memory optimization guidance supports deployment in resource-constrained environments

4. **Reduced Support Burden**
   - Comprehensive troubleshooting section will help users resolve common issues independently
   - Clear explanations of configuration options will reduce confusion and support requests

## Next Steps

Consider making the following additional documentation improvements:

1. Create dedicated guides for:
   - Monitoring and logging
   - Backup and disaster recovery
   - Multi-environment deployment (dev/staging/production)

2. Add more visual elements to documentation:
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Workflow charts
   - Configuration examples

3. Standardize documentation format:
   - Consistent headers
   - Standard sections (Overview, Prerequisites, Steps, Troubleshooting)
   - Uniform code block formatting
