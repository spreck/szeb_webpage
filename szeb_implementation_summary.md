# SZEB Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the enhanced GeoServer API with SLD Editor v3 integration for the SZEB WebGIS platform. The implementation provides specialized support for SZEB-specific data uploads and styling.

## Files Created or Modified

### Created Files
1. **API Routes**
   * `api/szeb_raster_routes.py` - Specialized routes for SZEB raster data processing with RAT support
   * `api/enhanced_sld_routes.py` - Routes for SLD editor integration and templates
   * `api/sld_templates.py` - Template system for SZEB-specific styling

2. **Frontend Files**
   * `static/js/admin/sld-editor-integration.js` - Integration with SLD Editor v3
   * `static/js/admin/template-previews.js` - Preview system for style templates
   * `static/js/admin/szeb-upload.js` - JavaScript handling for SZEB data upload interface
   * `templates/upload_szeb.html` - Template for SZEB species data upload

### Modified Files
1. **Application Files**
   * `app.py` - Updated to register new route blueprints
   * `routes.py` - Added route for SZEB upload page
   * `templates/admin.html` - Added link to SZEB upload page

## Key Features Implemented

### Enhanced Raster Upload Process
- Support for SZEB-specific raster data with embedded RAT attributes
- Automatic style generation based on RAT attributes
- Specialized color schemes for different SZEB categories
- Support for both PIPO and PSME species

### Vector Boundary Integration
- Uploading and management of vector boundaries for SZEB species
- Automatic creation of layer groups containing both raster and vector data
- Streamlined workflow for combined data management

### SLD Editor Integration
- Template-based styling system for consistent symbology
- Support for SZEB-specific attributes
- Enhanced style preview system
- Style copying from existing layers

### SZEB-Specific Templates
- Predefined styles for SZEB attributes like:
  - Climate Exposure Risk Category
  - Fire Intensity Risk Category
  - Current Supply Category
  - Landowner Demand Category
  - Operational Priority Category
  - Combined Risk Category

## Usage

### Uploading SZEB Data
1. Login to the admin interface
2. Click "Upload SZEB Data" button
3. Select species (PIPO or PSME)
4. Specify GeoServer workspace
5. Optionally select a template species for styling
6. Upload the raster GeoTIFF file and vector shapefile (with related files)
7. Submit the form to process the data
8. Review the upload results and access the created layers

### Using the SLD Editor
1. Navigate to layer management
2. Select a layer for styling
3. Choose a style template or copy from existing style
4. Customize the style in the editor
5. Save and apply to the layer

## Docker Deployment
The implementation is deployed through Docker Compose, with volume mounts ensuring the following:
- Template files are available at `/usr/src/app/templates`
- Static files (JS/CSS) are available at `/usr/src/app/static`
- API routes are available at `/usr/src/app/api`

The Docker Compose configuration provides integration with GeoServer and PostgreSQL with PostGIS.

## Recommendations for Future Enhancements
1. Expand template system to support additional species types
2. Add batch upload support for multiple species
3. Enhance error handling for partial failures
4. Provide additional visualization options for SZEB data
5. Create user documentation for the new features
