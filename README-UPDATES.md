# SZEB WebGIS Platform - Code Updates

## Recent Changes

We've made several improvements to the SZEB WebGIS platform code for better stability, security, and functionality:

### 1. Fixed Missing Endpoint Functions

- Added proper imports for SLD editor functions from enhanced_sld_routes.py
- Corrected endpoint mappings in setup_routes:
  - `/sld_editor` now uses `enhanced_sld_editor_page`
  - API endpoints use corresponding functions from enhanced_sld_routes

### 2. Improved API Response Formatting

- Standardized JSON responses across all tracking endpoints
- Changed plain text responses to structured JSON for better client compatibility

### 3. Enhanced Security

- Added CSRF exemption for login_test
- Added development-mode check for direct_login to prevent unauthorized access in production
- Improved docstrings for security-sensitive functions

### 4. Code Structure Improvements

- Removed redundant return statement at the end of setup_routes
- Added proper imports and fixed function references

## Next Steps

For production readiness, consider the following improvements:

1. Move hardcoded credentials to environment variables
2. Implement a proper cache with TTL for location lookups
3. Replace print() statements with logger calls
4. Add comprehensive docstrings for all routes
5. Consider adding rate limiting for sensitive routes

## Docker Deployment

The application is deployed using Docker Compose. After making changes to the codebase, simply restart the containers to apply the updates:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

The volume mounting ensures that file changes are immediately reflected in the running containers.
