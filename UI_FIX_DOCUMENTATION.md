# UI Fix Documentation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Login Popup Issue

**Problem:** 
The login popup kept appearing when users tried to access authenticated pages, creating a disruptive user experience.

**Root Cause:**
The `admin_auth_required` decorator in `auth.py` was storing the current URL in the session variable `next_url` before redirecting to the login page. After login, the user would be redirected back to the originally requested URL, creating a loop of popups for certain interactions.

**Solution:**
Modified the `admin_auth_required` decorator to simply redirect to the login page without storing the current URL in the session. This creates a cleaner authentication flow where the user is taken directly to the login page without the system trying to redirect them back to their original destination.

```python
def admin_auth_required(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated(*args, **kwargs):
        if not session.get('admin_logged_in'):
            # Redirect to the login page without storing the current URL
            return redirect(url_for('admin_login'))
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return decorated
```

### 2. Map Popup Accumulation Issue

**Problem:**
When clicking on multiple points on the map, popups would keep accumulating instead of being replaced, cluttering the interface.

**Root Cause:**
In the `handleMapClick` function in `script.js`, new popups were being created without closing existing ones. The `autoClose: false` and `closeOnClick: false` options were preventing automatic popup closure.

**Solution:**
Added a line to close any existing popups before creating a new one:

```javascript
// First, close any existing popups to ensure only one is visible at a time
mapManager.map.closePopup();
```

This ensures that only one popup is visible at any time, providing a cleaner user experience.

## Benefits of the Changes

1. **Improved User Experience:**
   - No more unexpected login popups
   - Cleaner map interface with only one popup visible at a time

2. **Better Authentication Flow:**
   - More predictable login behavior
   - Users can intentionally navigate to the login page when needed

3. **Reduced Visual Clutter:**
   - Map view is cleaner with only the most recent popup visible
   - Less confusing for users when analyzing multiple map points

## Implementation Notes

These changes are minimally invasive and focus specifically on the user interface issues without changing the core functionality of the application. The authentication system still works as intended, and the map's feature information display still functions correctly.
