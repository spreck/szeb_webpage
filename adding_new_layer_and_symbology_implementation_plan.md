# SZEB WebGIS: Layer Addition and Symbology Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for adding new layers and managing their symbology in the SZEB WebGIS platform, focusing on intelligent, user-friendly layer management.

## 2. Layer Discovery and Attribute Analysis

### 2.1 Automated Metadata Extraction
- Utilize GeoServer REST API for comprehensive layer metadata retrieval
- Extract detailed attribute information:
  * Attribute names
  * Data types
  * Value ranges
  * Statistical distributions

### 2.2 Attribute Similarity Scoring Algorithm
#### Scoring Criteria
- Attribute name matching (weighted 40%)
- Data type compatibility (weighted 25%)
- Value range similarity (weighted 20%)
- Semantic attribute name comparison (weighted 15%)

#### Similarity Score Interpretation
- 80-100%: Extremely similar layers
- 50-80%: Moderately similar layers
- <50%: Dissimilar layers

### 2.3 Machine Learning Enhancement
- Develop a classification model to:
  * Identify layer type
  * Suggest symbolization strategies
  * Improve matching accuracy through user interactions

## 3. Style Compatibility and Transfer Mechanism

### 3.1 Style Transfer Workflow
#### Automatic Transfer Rules
- 80-100% similarity: Complete automatic style transfer
- 50-80% similarity: Suggested style with mandatory user review
- <50% similarity: Manual styling recommended

### 3.2 Style Analysis Components
- SLD (Styled Layer Descriptor) deep analysis
- Extraction of:
  * Color schemes
  * Classification methods
  * Symbolization techniques
  * Legend generation rules

### 3.3 Intelligent Style Suggestion Engine
- Centralized style template library
- Context-aware style recommendations
- Supported Symbolization Strategies:
  * Categorical
  * Graduated
  * Continuous
  * Heat map

## 4. Manual Style Customization Framework

### 4.1 SLD Editor Enhancements
- Advanced, intuitive editing interface
- Features:
  * Drag-and-drop styling
  * Real-time preview
  * Undo/redo functionality
  * Responsive design

### 4.2 Comprehensive Styling Options
- Color palette selection
- Transparency controls
- Classification method selection
- Custom rule creation
- Dynamic legend generation

### 4.3 Validation and Compliance
- SLD syntax validation
- Performance impact assessment
- GeoServer compatibility checking
- Automatic error correction suggestions

## 5. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Develop attribute extraction API
- Create similarity scoring algorithm
- Build basic style transfer mechanism

### Phase 2: Machine Learning Integration
- Train initial classification model
- Implement user feedback loop
- Enhance style suggestion accuracy

### Phase 3: User Interface Development
- Create SLD editor interface
- Implement style preview functionality
- Develop comprehensive user guidance

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement
- Conduct extensive user testing
- Gather performance metrics
- Iterative improvements based on feedback

## 6. Technical Requirements

### Backend
- Python (Flask)
- GeoServer REST API integration
- Machine learning model (scikit-learn/TensorFlow)
- PostgreSQL for metadata storage

### Frontend
- React-based SLD editor
- Real-time preview capabilities
- Responsive design
- Accessibility compliance

## 7. Success Metrics
- Attribute matching accuracy
- Style transfer success rate
- User satisfaction score
- Performance overhead

## 8. Future Considerations
- Community style sharing
- Advanced machine learning models
- Support for more complex geospatial data types
